## Tier 5: Agencies/Consultancies (Partnership Opportunities)

### Partner with Agencies Who Need AI Expertise

These agencies have clients but lack AI engineering:

- **Postlight** - Strategy, design, engineering
- **Your Local Tech Agency** - Search "[your city] web development agency"

**Approach:**
"Hi [Agency], I'm an AI/ML engineer specializing in RAG/agents. I work with agencies as a technical partner when their clients need AI features. Would a quick intro call make sense?"

**Why this works:**
- Agencies have deal flow but not AI talent
- You become their "AI expert on retainer"
- Steady pipeline of projects
