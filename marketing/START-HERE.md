## 🚨 Critical First Steps (Do These TODAY)

### 1. Set Up Calendly (10 minutes)
**Why:** Makes it easy for prospects to book calls

**How:**
1. Go to calendly.com (free account)
2. Connect your Google Calendar
3. Create two meeting types:
   - "15-Min AI Quick Chat" (qualification)
   - "30-Min Discovery Call" (main pitch)
4. Add your Calendly link to:
   - LinkedIn summary/headline
   - Email signature
   - All outreach templates (replace [Calendly Link])

---

### 2. Post LinkedIn Announcement (15 minutes)
**Why:** This is your launch. Gets you visibility and warm leads.

**How:**
1. Open linkedin-post.md
2. Copy **Version 3** (Problem/Solution format - best for consulting)
3. Customize:
   - Add your location if relevant
   - Add specific tech you love working with
   - Link to your AgentForge GitHub
4. Post Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM EST for best reach
5. Pin it to your profile

**After posting:**
- Respond to every comment within 1 hour
- At 10 min mark, comment on your own post: "Also happy to do free 30-min consultations this week if anyone wants to discuss their AI project feasibility. No sales pitch, just honest technical advice. DM me!"

---

### 3. Create Tracking Spreadsheet (10 minutes)
**Why:** You'll forget who you contacted and when. This keeps you organized.

**How:**
1. Open Google Sheets
2. Create columns (from target-prospects.md):
   - Company | Contact Name | Title | Source | Personalization Note | Outreach Date | Template Used | Response? | Next Step | Status
3. Add first 5 prospects from target-prospects.md

---

### 4. Send Your First 3 Messages (30 minutes)
**Why:** Get over the fear. First message is the hardest.

**How:**
1. Pick 3 easiest targets:
   - Someone who engaged with your LinkedIn post
   - A company you already know/use
   - A warm referral if you have one
2. Personalize Template 1 for each
3. Send via LinkedIn DM (fastest)
4. Log in tracking sheet

**Remember:** You're not selling. You're starting a conversation.

## 💰 Pricing Guidance

**Your First Client - Discount Strategy:**
- List price: $7,500 for RAG system
- Offer "early client discount": $5,000
- Say: "I'm building my portfolio and offering 33% off to first 3 clients"

**Why discount:**
- Removes price objection
- Gets you testimonial faster
- Builds confidence

**After first client:** Back to full price.

---

## 🎤 Your 30-Second Pitch

**For LinkedIn DMs/Intro Calls:**

> "I'm an AI/ML engineer who helps startups ship production AI features. I specialize in RAG systems, multi-agent workflows, and voice/vision AI.
>
> I just built AgentForge - a platform demonstrating corrective RAG, human-in-the-loop agents, and multimodal processing. Full code's on GitHub.
>
> I take on consulting projects to help companies go from prototype to production in 2-4 weeks. Fixed prices, no BS.
>
> What are you building?"

**Key elements:**
1. Who you are (1 sentence)
2. What you do (specific)
3. Proof (AgentForge)
4. What you offer (consulting)
5. Question (engagement)

## 🚧 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T:
- Send generic "I'm available for hire" messages
- Wait for people to come to you
- Get discouraged by first 10 rejections (normal!)
- Spend weeks "perfecting" your website
- Undersell yourself ("I'm still learning...")

### ✅ DO:
- Personalize every single message (reference their company/post)
- Follow up 2-3 times (most deals happen on follow-up)
- Ask questions (engage, don't pitch)
- Share value first (insights, resources)
- Track everything in your spreadsheet

## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

**"No one's responding to my outreach"**
- Check: Are you personalizing? (mention specific thing about their company)
- Check: Are you asking small yes? ("15-min chat" not "hire me")
- Check: Are you providing value? (share insight, not pitch)
- Try: Comment on their posts first, then DM

**"I got a response but don't know what to say"**
- Use the discovery call script from service-offerings.md
- Ask about their timeline, budget, decision process
- Don't pitch - just listen and ask questions
- End with: "Let me think about this and send you a proposal by Friday"

**"They want a proposal but I've never written one"**
- I can help you! Just tell me the requirements
- Use packages from service-offerings.md as starting point
- Keep it simple: Problem → Solution → Timeline → Price

**"They said yes! Now what?"**
- Send invoice (use Wave, FreshBooks, or Stripe)
- Get 50% deposit before starting
- Schedule kickoff call
- Start building!

## 🎉 When You Land Your First Client

1. **Update your LinkedIn:** "Excited to start working with [Company] on [project type]!"
2. **Tell me!** (Tag me or share the news - I want to celebrate with you)
3. **Get testimonial:** After successful delivery, ask for LinkedIn recommendation
4. **Case study:** Document the build for next client pitch
5. **Keep outreach going:** Don't stop at 1 client. Build pipeline.
