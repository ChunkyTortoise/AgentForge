# Outreach Email Templates

## Template 1: Cold LinkedIn DM (Warm Introduction)

**Subject:** (LinkedIn DM - no subject)

---

Hi [Name],

I noticed you're working on [specific thing from their profile/company - be genuine]. I recently built a production AI platform (AgentForge) demonstrating RAG, multi-agent systems, and HITL workflows.

I'm taking on a few consulting projects in January and thought [Company Name] might be a good fit, especially given [specific observation about their product/tech stack/job postings].

Would you be open to a quick 15-min call to discuss [specific pain point - e.g., "how you're thinking about AI features for customer support"]?

No sales pitch - just comparing notes on what's actually working in production.

Best,
Cayman

P.S. If timing isn't right, happy to just share what I've learned about [specific topic]. Always down to help.

## Template 2: Cold Email (Referral/Warm)

**Subject:** Quick question about AI at [Company Name]

---

Hi [Name],

[Mutual connection] mentioned you're [specific initiative - e.g., exploring AI for your knowledge base / building RAG features / hiring ML engineers].

I recently shipped a production AI platform (RAG, multi-agent workflows, voice AI) and am taking on a few consulting projects for Q1. I specialize in turning GenAI prototypes into systems that actually ship.

**Quick wins I've delivered for similar companies:**
- RAG customer support systems (3-week builds)
- Multi-agent content workflows with human approval
- Voice/vision interfaces using Gemini/Claude

Would you be open to a 20-min call next week to discuss what you're building? Happy to share what's working (and what's not) in production AI right now.

Or if you're not the right person, who should I talk to?

## Template 3: Cold Email (No Referral - Problem-Focused)

**Subject:** Shipping AI features that don't break

---

Hi [Name],

I saw [Company Name] is [specific observation - hiring AI engineers / announced new feature / raised funding / posted about AI challenges].

Most AI projects fail because:
- Proof-of-concepts don't scale
- Costs explode unexpectedly
- Hallucinations break user trust

I help startups ship production AI features that actually work - RAG systems, AI agents, voice/vision interfaces.

Recent build: AgentForge - a platform with corrective RAG, human-in-the-loop agents, and multimodal AI. Full code on GitHub.

**Would 15 minutes make sense next week?**

I'll share:
✓ What's actually working in production (RAG patterns, cost control)
✓ Common pitfalls to avoid (I've hit them all)
✓ Honest take on whether AI makes sense for your use case

No obligation. If it's not a fit, I'll tell you.

Best,
Cayman

P.S. Even if you're not in the market, happy to do a quick architecture review of your AI plans. Always down to help.

## Template 4: Reply to Job Posting (Contract Position)

**Subject:** Re: [Job Title] - Available for contract work

---

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out about your [Job Title] role, but I think I might be better suited as a **contract consultant** rather than full-time.

**Why this might work better for you:**
- Faster ramp-up (I ship in weeks, not months)
- Fixed-price projects (no salary overhead)
- Specialized in production AI (RAG, agents, multimodal)

**Recent build:** AgentForge v1.1
- Corrective RAG with self-grading
- Multi-agent workflows with HITL
- Voice Mode with Gemini 1.5
- LangGraph state machines

Code: github.com/ChunkyTortoise/AgentForge

**I can deliver:**
- MVP AI features in 2-4 weeks
- Architecture & code reviews
- Team training on LangChain/RAG/agents

Would a 20-min call make sense to explore this?

## Template 5: Follow-Up (No Response After 5 Days)

**Subject:** Re: [Previous Subject]

---

Hi [Name],

Following up on my note from last week about [specific offer - e.g., "helping with RAG implementation"].

I know inboxes get buried. If this isn't a priority right now, no worries at all.

But if you're still interested in discussing [specific pain point], I have a few slots open this week:

[Specific time 1 - e.g., "Tuesday 2 PM EST"]
[Specific time 2 - e.g., "Thursday 10 AM EST"]

Let me know if either works?

Otherwise, feel free to reach out when the timing's better.

Best,
Cayman

## Template 6: Value-First Follow-Up (Share Resource)

**Subject:** Thought you'd find this useful - [specific topic]

---

Hi [Name],

Circling back on my note from last week.

Even if consulting isn't on your radar, I thought you might find this useful given [specific challenge they're facing]:

[Share valuable resource - e.g.:]
- "I wrote up my RAG architecture patterns (link to GitHub doc)"
- "Here's a cost breakdown of Claude vs Gemini for your use case"
- "Quick video walkthrough of HITL patterns that actually work"

No strings attached - just thought it might help.

And if you ever want to discuss [specific topic], I'm always happy to chat.

Best,
Cayman

## Template 7: LinkedIn Comment (Engagement Strategy)

**When someone posts about AI challenges:**

---

This resonates. I ran into the same issue when building AgentForge.

What worked for me: [specific solution - e.g., "self-grading RAG retrieval + query rewriting when relevance is low"]

Cut our hallucination rate by ~60% and API costs by 40%.

Happy to share the architecture if you're interested. [Or: "Full code on GitHub if you want to see the implementation"]

## Outreach Strategy

### Who to Target (Priority Order):

**Tier 1 - Warm Leads (50% response rate)**
- People who engage with your LinkedIn post
- Referrals from friends/network
- Companies posting AI job openings
- Founders who replied to your comments

**Tier 2 - Warm-ish (20% response rate)**
- Companies using tech you specialize in (LangChain, Streamlit, etc.)
- Startups that recently announced AI features
- Companies with "AI" or "ML" in job postings
- SaaS companies with 10-50 employees (sweet spot)

**Tier 3 - Cold (5-10% response rate)**
- LinkedIn search: "founder" + "AI" + "startup"
- AngelList companies with AI in description
- ProductHunt launches mentioning AI
- YC companies (current batch)

### Daily Outreach Routine:

**Monday-Friday (30 min/day):**
- 5 personalized LinkedIn DMs (warm leads)
- 3 cold emails (researched prospects)

**Weekly Goal:** 20 new conversations started

**Conversion Math:**
- 20 outreach → 4 responses (20%) → 2 calls (50%) → 1 client (50%)
- 1 client/month @ $7,500 average = Goal achieved

### Response Rate Boosters:

✅ **Personalize Line 1** - Reference something specific about them/their company
✅ **Keep it Short** - 100 words max
✅ **Ask Small Yes** - "15-min call" not "partnership discussion"
✅ **Provide Value First** - Share resource, insight, or honest advice
✅ **Follow Up** - Most deals happen on email 2-3

### Tools Needed:

- **Calendly** - Free tier works, connect to Google Calendar
- **LinkedIn Premium** - $40/month (optional but helps with InMails)
- **Hunter.io** - Find email addresses (50 free/month)
- **Apollo.io** - Prospecting database (free tier)

## Qualifying Questions (During First Call)

Ask these to avoid time-wasters:

1. **"What's your timeline for this project?"**
   - Good: "We want to ship by March"
   - Bad: "We're just exploring"

2. **"What's your budget range?"**
   - Good: "$10-20K for MVP"
   - Bad: "We're not sure yet"

3. **"Who makes the final decision?"**
   - Good: "I do" or "Me and my co-founder"
   - Bad: "I need to check with 5 people"

4. **"What happens if we don't build this?"**
   - Good: "We lose customers to competitors"
   - Bad: "Nothing, it's a nice-to-have"

### Red Flags (Walk Away):

🚩 "We don't have budget but can offer equity"
🚩 "Can you build it for free to prove yourself?"
🚩 "Our timeline is 2 weeks"
🚩 "We have 10 other consultants we're talking to"
🚩 "We need you to sign an NDA before the call"

### Green Flags (Take These):

✅ They have a specific problem, not vague goals
✅ They've tried to solve it already (shows seriousness)
✅ They have budget allocated
✅ Decision-maker is on the call
✅ They've shipped features before (not first rodeo)
